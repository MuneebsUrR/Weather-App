# Weather App
This is a weather app that I have created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, vanilla JavaScript, and the OpenWeather API. The app utilizes the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data for any location.

## Features
- Real-time weather information: The app fetches data from the OpenWeather API to provide accurate and up-to-date weather information for any location.
- Geolocation: The app includes a geolocation function that automatically fetches the user's current location and displays the weather data for that location.
- User-friendly interface: The app has been designed with a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy to use and navigate.
- Responsive design: The app is built with a responsive design, ensuring that it looks great and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How to Use
1) Clone the repository.
2) Go to the OpenWeatherMap website and sign up for an account. After signing up and logging in, go to your profile and navigate to the "API keys" section to generate a new API key. This key will allow your application to access the OpenWeatherMap API. 
3) Open the index.html file in your preferred browser.
4) Allow the app to access your location when prompted, or search for a specific location using the search bar.
5) The app will fetch and display the current weather information for the selected location.

## Future Enhancements
Here are some possible enhancements for future versions of the app:

- Add additional weather data such as precipitation, UV index, and visibility.
- Implement a toggle to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- Include additional features such as weather alerts and sunrise/sunset times.
- Improve the design and styling of the app for a more engaging user experience.
